#Interview Project

Demonstrates proficiency in HTML / CSS / JavaScript and JQuery.  This took me about 7 hours in total.

##Setup
After cloning the repo, navigate to `index.html` and `luigi.html`.  These two pages represent a mockup of a department page and a personal profile of Luigi, a front end web engineer.

##Features of note:
* Hovering over the marketing and communications `li` on the right side will trigger the position descriptions to change color.
* Scrolling on the index page triggers parallax behaviour, with the hero image sinking underneath the rest of the content.
* On Luigi's bio, hovering over his Manager and Direct reports will trigger a thumbnail of the person to turn visible.
